# Lifesteal
### A 1.20.4 Fabric Enchantment Mod
Adds a lifesteal enchantment to the game. Restores life on hit.


As of right now, the mod is completely usable in its current state — it appears in enchanting tables, works as intended, and is decently balanced — however, I would like to iterate on this idea and make it more fleshed out in the future once I have more knowledge on Fabric's inner workings.
